## Description

The goal of this project is to create an application that allows users to view the current weather as well as the next five days. Using the OpenWeatherMaps Geocoding API, user's are able to input their city of their choosing to see the forecast of that city. This also allows users to see different information of that city such as temperature, humidity, and humidity levels as well.
